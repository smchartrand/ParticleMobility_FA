# ParticleMobility_FA
This repository hosts a friction-angle based particle mobility model for sediment transport calculations.
The model has been developed based on the work of Wiberg and Smith, 1987 (WRR) and Kirchner et al., 1990 (Sedimentology). The repository hosts both the Matlab based and Python based model files. NOTE: the python model files are still in development, and I have been testing the OMPC translator for this task. No input files are necessary to run the working Matlab based model. The user simply ansers a few questions via dialogue prompts. The model has been tested on Matlab 2014b-2016a and is functional; it works for Windows and Linux (tested on Debian Jessie) Matlab distributions.
