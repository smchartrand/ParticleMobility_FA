# ParticleMobility_FA
This repository hosts a friction-angle based particle mobility model for sediment transport calculations.
The model has been developed based on the work of Wiberg and Smith, 1987 (WRR) and Kirchner et al., 1990 (Sedimentology). 
The model is intended for use with grain sizes ranging from fine sand (0.125 mm) to cobbles (256 mm). The model is not intended for use with sediment particles which are typically suspended in the water column, or boulder sized sediments (although it may be appropriate for boulders).  
The repository hosts both the Matlab based and Python based model files. NOTE: the python model files are still in development, and I have been testing the OMPC translator for this task. 
No input files are necessary to run the working Matlab based model. The user simply ansers a few questions via dialogue prompts. 
The model has been successfully tested with Matlab 2014b-2016a, for Windows 7 and Linux Debian Jessie distribution.
